How do you feel about ads? 
In my view, some ads can be annoying while others are humorous and amusing. On the one hand, during a TV show or movie, ads can be really bothersome and disruptive. However, they could light up my mood if they are delightful and funny.


Do you like advertisements on TV or in magazines? 
I don' t often read magazines and most of the ads that I see are on TV. I feel that TV ads are becoming more and more innovative and creative and I sincerely hope to see more fascinating ones in the future.

Which kind of advertisements is the most popular one in your country? 
Based on my experience, ads for cars are the most popular one in my country.
