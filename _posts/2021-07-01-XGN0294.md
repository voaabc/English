--- Lesson 94 Future champions
未来的冠军
--- First listen and then answer the question.
听录音，然后回答以下问题。
--- What kind of race do the children compete in?

Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age.
实验证明，儿童在很小的时候就可以开始学习游泳。
At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles,
在洛杉矶的一个特设的游泳池里，
children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can walk.
孩子们甚至在还没有学会走路时就已经能熟练地在水下屏住呼吸了。
Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water.
两个月的婴儿并未显得不愿意入水。
It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool.
他们很快便适应了游泳，以致能捡起池底的物品。
A game that is very popular with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race.
这些幼小的游泳运动员非常喜爱的一种游戏是水下三轮车比赛。
Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water.
三轮车并排放在7英尺深的游泳池底上。
The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool.
孩子们比赛看谁先到达游泳池的另一端。
Many pedal their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them.
很多孩子用脚蹬车，但多数孩子更愿意推或是拉着三轮车。
Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without coming up for breath even once.
有些孩子能够跑完游泳池的全长而不用露出水面换气。
Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time will tell.
他们将来是否能成为奥林匹克的冠军，这只能由时间来作出回答。
Meanwhile, they should encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for air.
与此同时，他们对我们中的那些游不了5码就已喘不过气来的人应该是种鼓舞。
